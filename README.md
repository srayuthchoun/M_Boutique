# MBoutique

## About the Project
This project was originally designed to understand html layout and css styling using design docs that were provided from a fictitious company named MBoutique.  After completing the project, I decided to make the site more responsive using Bootstrap. Also, making the site load faster to different content using Angular routing.

##Implemented Features
1. Mobile Responsive
